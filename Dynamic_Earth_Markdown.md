**GEO 3010– Dynamic Earth (3 credits)**

**Lecture:** FASB XXX, 9:40-10:30 a.m., M, W

**Lab:** FASB XXX, 9:40-10:30 a.m., F

**Instructors:** *P1*: Lin, Koper, Thorne, Zhadnov; *P2*: Moore, Bartley,
Jewell, Lippert

**Course Description:** This course will focus on the application of continuum
mechanics to describe geologic processes and phenomena. We will cover a range of
diverse topics spanning the inner and outer Earth including: elasticity,
tectonics, heat flow, gravity, fluid dynamics, faulting, seismology, surface
processes, and geological hazards. Students will learn fundamental physical and
mathematical approaches to quantitatively describe, interpret, and predict a
broad range of dynamic processes in Earth systems. Two lectures, one lab weekly.

**Required Pre-requisites:** Physics I (PHYS 2210)

**Recommended Co-requisites:** Calculus II (MATH 1220), Physics II (PHYS 2220)

**Required Text:** *Geodynamis 3rd ed., Turcotte and Schubert*. Additional /
supplemental readings will be provided electronically via canvas.

**1. Policies**

*Grades:* Final grades are based on following weights:

-   Weekly problem sets from text (25%)

-   Laboratory / workshop assignments (25%)

-   Exam 1 (25%)

-   Exam 2 (25%)

*Homework:* Problem sets will be assigned each week from the textbook or related
reading and are due at the start of lab on Friday. Late assignments will be
assessed a minimum penalty of 25% per week they are overdue.

*Labs:* Concepts introduced in lectures will be explored through interactive
workshops where students work in teams to solve problems relating to dynamic
Earth processes. Assignments are due after one week at the start of lab each
Friday; late assignments will be assessed a penalty of 25% per week they are
overdue.

*Exams:* Two exams will cover the first and second halves of the course,
respectively. The final exam is not cumulative.

**2. Class Goals**

Students will be able to:

-   *Need a concise list of learning goals here…*

-   Understand physical laws underlying transfer and balance of energy, heat,
    force, and mass, and other kinetic processes and balances in Earth systems.

-   Derive physical and mathematical approaches to describe, interpret, and
    predict a range of dynamic processes in Earth systems.

-   Apply essential mathematical descriptions of dynamic phenomena to describe
    key processes in the interior of the Earth and on the Earth’s surface.

**5. Additional Notes**

**Statement Concerning Disabilities:** “The University of Utah seeks to provide
equal access to its programs, services and activities for people with
disabilities. If you will need accommodations in the class, reasonable prior
notice needs to be given to the Center for Disability Services, 162 Union
Building, 581-5020 (V/TDD). CDS will work with you and the instructor to make
arrangements for accommodations.”

(www.hr.utah.edu/oeo/ada/guide/faculty).

**Faculty and Student Responsibilities:** “All students are expected to maintain
professional behavior in the classroom setting, according to the Student Code,
spelled out in the Student Handbook. Students have specific rights in the
classroom as detailed in Article III of the code. The Code also specifies
proscribed conduct (Article XI) that involves cheating on tests, plagiarism,
and/or collusion, as well as fraud, theft, etc. Students should read the Code
carefully and know they are responsible for the content. According to Faculty
Rules and Regulations, it is the faculty responsibility to enforce responsible
classroom behaviors, beginning with verbal warnings and progressing to dismissal
from class and a failing grade. Students have the right to appeal such action to
the Student Behavior Committee.”

“Faculty… must strive in the classroom to maintain a climate conducive to
thinking and learning.” PPM 8-12.3, B.

“Students have a right to support and assistance from the University in
maintaining a climate conducive to thinking and learning.” PPM 8-10, II. A.

**Addressing Sexual Misconduct:** Title IX makes it clear that violence and
harassment based on sex and gender (which includes sexual orientation and gender
identity / expression) is a Civil Rights offense subject to the same kinds of
accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other
protected categories such as race, national origin, color, religion, age, status
as a person with a disability, veteran’s status or genetic information. If you
or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you are encouraged to report
it to the Title IX Coordinator in the Office of Equal Opportunity and
Affirmative Action, 135 Park Building, 801-581-8365, or the Office of the Dean
of Students, 270 Union Building, 801-581-7066.  For support and confidential
consultation, contact the Center for Student Wellness, 426 SSB, 801-581-7776. 
To report to the police, contact the Department of Public Safety,
801-585-2677(COPS).
